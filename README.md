# datacamp_foodyum
The Project was a part of the DataCamp Data Analyst Associate Certification which I unfortunately did not pass the practical exam on November 27th 2023. But in the project shown here, every errors was fixed and the code should run fine. My mistake was 'meat' instead of 'Meat' with uppercase "M" in task 4. Thanks for reading.
The output of the preview can be accessed through DataCamp Workspace here: https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/5c85e181-61d8-49cd-b76a-545a0d143522/edit
